This is the development blog for the
[Athologion Litugical Project](http://anthologion.faith). The aim of
this project it to provide a system that can be used to share liturgical texts
of various Christian denominations or other faiths.

The maintainer of this project is an

so initial tasks will focus on those texts which are most useful and
interesting to him.

The production site is [http://anthologion.faith](http://anthologion.faith)
